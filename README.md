Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks

A fully connected neural network consists of a series of fully connected layers. A fully connected layer is a function from ℝ m to ℝ n . Each output dimension depends on each input dimension. 


The nodes in fully connected networks are commonly referred to as “neurons.” Consequently, elsewhere in the literature, fully connected networks will commonly be referred to as “neural networks.” This nomenclature is largely a historical accident.
